1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

     HTTP1.1:
        *HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
        *detailed control over prioritization is not possible.
        * compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.


     HTTP2:
       * while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
       *developers have detailed control over prioritization.
       *uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK
